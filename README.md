This is a full-stack application comprising of a Node.js-based backend API with JWT authentication and MongoDB serving as the database. The application's frontend is developed using React, which utilizes Axios to interact with the backend API through HTTP requests. The system provides a user sign-up feature where users can register using their email and password, which is encrypted and then stored in the database. After successful registration, users can log in using their credentials and receive a JWT token and a refresh token. The JWT token allows users to authenticate themselves for accessing all the protected routes, while the refresh token can be utilized to acquire a new JWT token once the previous one expires.
